How to make charts and other graphics - guidance for editorial practitioners.

##Intro

We think successful graphics exhibit the following properties

1. They should induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic production or something else.
2. avoid distorting or misrepresenting data
3. encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data
4. serve a clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation, or decoration
5. be closely integrated with statistical and verbal descriptions of the data set. [1](#end-notes)

##What is a graphic

A visual representaion of a dataset, at a minimum a graphic must have:

A title, a key (or graphical elements directly labeled), a data source, one or more mappings of variables within the data set to a visual dimension.

##Process

###What is the story
###What is the chart's message
###Commission/ create
###Check it
###Position within the page

##Chart types
### line
### column
### bar
### pie
### histogram
### scatter
### complicated stuff

## Charts from somewhere else
We should always prefer creating charts from raw data but sometimes this isn't possible. I that case the original chart should be used at the best available resolution and sourced appropriately. Charts and maps are subject to copyright, make sure you have permission of the copyright holder in the same way you would for a photograph or illustration.

## Visual dimensions

##Good chart bad chart

... some examples, good and bad
